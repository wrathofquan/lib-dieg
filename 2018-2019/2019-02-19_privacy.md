# Data Initiatives Expertise Group- Privacy, Security, Data, and You

## Privacy and personal information in law and policy

In many research contexts, there are privacy and security concerns around data. The most commonly discussed use case is [personally identifiable information or **PII**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information). 

+ NIST published [-Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)-](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-122/final) which describes [**Fair Information Practices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_fair_information_practice) (a foundation of many privacy laws) and recommendations or protections and safeguards PII data, and response plans for incidents involving PII.
+ There are many laws related to the collection and storage of PII.
+ [**The U.S. Privacy Act of 1974** 5 U.S.C. ยง 552a](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974) established Code of Fair Information Practice to govern issues around collection and use of PII by federal agencies.
+ [**HIPAA**](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) and the [**HITECH Act**](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html) are federal U.S. laws that deal with personal medical information.
+ [**FERPA**](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) is the U.S. that protects the priavacy of student education records. 
+ [**California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375) which is currently going thorugh the [rulemaking process](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) and comments are due March 8, 2019.
+ [The EU General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**)](https://eugdpr.org/) is the 2016 law (enacted in 2018) that harmonized data privacy laws across the EU, changed how organizations handle data privacy, and created a market for internet cookie pop-ups on most websites across the internet. 

For many academic research projects, the IRB considers these issues when looking at proposed protocols. See the [DIEG IRB notes](https://github.com/wrathofquan/lib-dieg/blob/master/2018-2019/2018-11-20_IRB.md) for more about that process.

There are also many ethical questions surrounding research in libraries using PII, especially around learning analytics.*

## Resources and guidelines from UC Berkeley

For research on campus that uses data that includes PII, there are a number resources and guidelines for different applications. 

The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) has [this FAQ](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/faqs.html) that presents a number considerations touching upon policies from regular research funders, federal and state regulations, and campus concerns. 



The UC Berkeley office of Information Security Policy
has guidelines for the campus policy on [Data Access Agreements](https://security.berkeley.edu/data-access-agreement-guidelines), which is more generally referred to as a Data Use Agreement (DUA). These guidelines issues around privacy and risk, and how they should be addressed. They also [provide a comparison](https://security.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-box-and-google-data-use-agreement) of the DUA between Box and Google Apps for Education (bDrive and bMail). Concerns are separated by different data protection levels. They also link to other campus resources that might be necessary.

There is also a [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) working group currently developing security guidelines and practices for research data at Berkeley. This group [published a whitepaper about the current state of practice and future directions](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/blog/18/12/03/improving-campus-services-working-sensitive-data) in December 2017.
