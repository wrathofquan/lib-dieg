## Git for Data Initiatives Expertise Group

> Objectives
- Differentiate between Git and Github
- Jargon bust: "pull request",  _status_, _clone_, _add_, _commit_, _push_,  _fetch_, _merge_

## *What* is Git & Github

- Version Control: Like *undo*, *Ctrl- Z*  and *history* with superpowers

- Git: The language

- Github: A service for the language

- Can interact with the language, GUIs like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), or directly on the Github website.


## So, *What*


- Sign the [Code4Lib Community Statement in Support of Chris Bourg](http://www.arl.org/news/arl-news/4487-arl-denounces-harassment-of-chris-bourg-following-code4lib-keynote#.Wx17oVMvzOR)

- Tools like this advance transparency in software and data analysis.

- This is how many researchers and leaners who code work together.

- More and more librarians use Git for their own projects

- More and more librarians introduce Git as a workflow/management solution to their researchers.

- You can work offline

- You can time-travel and go to different states of your work infinitely.


## *What's* Next?

- Use Git to update our DIEG teach-Ins. Together, we'll troubleshoot and learn in a way that allows us to use Git in a simplified, immediately usable way.

- [Git Guide, "No deep shit"](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)


## Example workflows

<br>


<details>

<summary> Collaborate using "pull requests": command line</summary>

<br>

- Sign up for [Github](https://github.com/join)

- Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- Go to our [DIEG Repo](https://github.com/wrathofquan/lib-dieg)

- Click on 'Fork' ![](../images/fork.png)
  - this will make a copy to your Github account


- Copy the https link from your forked repo ![ ](../images/https.png)

- Open terminal

- ```git clone https://github.com/wrathofquan/lib-dieg.git```
  - This takes your copy of the original and puts it on your computer to begin working.


-  Make some changes to the files.

- ```git status```

  - this is my most used command. tells me where i'm at! use this often. it's non-destructive and really useful.

- ```git add name_of_file_you've_changed ```

  - Tell git to track your change


- ```git commit -m "a quick descriptive message of what you did"```

  - Tell git you're serious about this change


- ```git push origin master```

  - Tell git to send your changes to **your** Copy


- Go to your **forked** copy and make a new pull request to the owner of the original

![](../images/pull.png)

- Review your changes and submit!

<details>

<summary> Fetch, merge, pull...</summary>

- When you are working on your own cloned fork, others will be working on their own cloned forks too! If you attempt to push your own changes without being up to date with your colleague's changes then git will tell you something like this:

``` ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/wrathofquan/lib-dieg.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

```

- ```git fetch origin```

  -  will take the state of the original repo and bring it to yours

- ```git diff master origin/master```

  - show the differences

- ```git merge origin```

  - seal the deal and merge your work (git revert or reset can undo this if something bad happens here)


- add, commit, and push your changes!
